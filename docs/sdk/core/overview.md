# The Pegasys Core SDK

> **Welcome to the V3 Core SDK!**

The Pegasys Core SDK provides abstractions for other SDKs to use in a Typescript/Javascript environment. It is used throughout the Pegasys SDKs, such as the [V3 SDK](../v3/overview.md).

This SDK is not expected to be used in isolation, but only as part of other SDKs.

We recommend taking a look at the [**Technical Reference**](./reference/overview).

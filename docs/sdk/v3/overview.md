# The Pegasys V2 SDK

> **Welcome to the V2 Pegasys SDK!**

The Pegasys V2 SDK provides abstractions to assist you with interacting with the Pegasys V2 smart contracts in a Typescript/Javascript environment (e.g. websites, node scripts). It makes uses of the [**Core SDK**](../core/overview.md) to gain access to abstractions that are common amongst the Pegasys SDKs. With the SDK, you can manipulate data that has been queried from the [EVM](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/) using libraries that assist with needs such as data modeling, protection from rounding errors, and compile time enforced typing.

To begin, we recommend looking at our [**Guides**](./guides/01-background.md) which include [runnable examples](https://github.com/Pegasys/examples/tree/main/v2-sdk) and walkthroughs of core usages. These guides will help you better understand how to use the SDK and integrate it into your application.

For complete documentation of the SDK's offerings, see the [**Technical Reference**](./reference/overview.md).

## Installation

To interact with the V2 SDK we recommend installing though npm:

```bash
npm i --save @pegasys-fi/v2-sdk

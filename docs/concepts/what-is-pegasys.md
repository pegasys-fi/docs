## Protocol, Interface, Labs

To begin, we should make clear the distinctions between the different areas of "Pegasys", some of which may confuse new users.

- **Pegasys Labs**: The company which developed the Pegasys protocol, along with the web interface.
- **The Pegasys Protocol**: A suite of persistent, non-upgradable smart contracts that together create an automated market maker, a protocol that facilitates peer-to-peer market making and swapping of ERC-20 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain.
- **The Pegasys Interface**: A web interface that allows for easy interaction with the Pegasys protocol. The interface is only one of many ways one may interact with the Pegasys protocol.
- **Pegasys Governance**: A governance system for governing the Pegasys Protocol, enabled by the PSYS token.
